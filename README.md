# ocean-levels

Web app for climate change that will show the coasts in the world that would be submerged if global average ocean levels or temperature were to rise by a certain amount.

# setup
Golang code for parsing world coastline data and integrating it with elevation data fetched from Google Maps Elevation API, along with the coastline data itself.
Go program would not run right now because is not in proper Go directory structure.

# Google API Key
All instances of ```<API_KEY>``` in this repo must be replaced with your API key if you intend to run the code locally.
To get one, you must create a Google Cloud Project and enable billing and the necessary APIs (Google Maps JavaScript and Elevation), and then create an API Key in the Credentials section.

# TODO
Finish webapp locally (webapp is not pushed to this repo yet)
